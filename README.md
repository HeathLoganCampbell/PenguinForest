#  `Penguin Forest`
When I was a wee lad my first moment joining Club Penguin was in the forest to grab a rare item. Since then, I had always dreamed and wondered how could I make something like Club Penguin, so now, after a few years of development under my belt, I thought I would recreate the basic idea from scratch.

### v0.1 - Snowballs and waddling

The basic idea is there, you can click on snowy parts of the map and your penguin will walk there with a waddle animation. You can also right click on a location on the level to throw a snowball
